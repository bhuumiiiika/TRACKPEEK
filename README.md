🕵‍♀ Trackpeek — Web Surveillance Visualizer

Trackpeek is a privacy-focused tool that scans websites to uncover cookies, trackers, and third-party domains collecting user data — and transforms that data into *interactive visual reports*.

🚨 Problem

In the modern web, users are tracked without their knowledge — through cookies, scripts, and third-party services. This silent surveillance compromises privacy, fuels profiling, and powers aggressive ads.

Most privacy tools either block trackers without explanation or overwhelm users with technical data. Trackpeek takes a different route — it *visualizes what's happening, making web surveillance clear, understandable, and educational.
🌐 Features

- *🔍 Cookie & Tracker Breakdown*  
  Categorized view of all cookies and trackers (e.g., analytics, ads, social).

- *🌍 Geo-Map of Tracker Origins*  
  Visual map of where your data is sent globally via third-party trackers.

- *🔐 Privacy Score*  
  Simple grading system based on tracking behavior, HTTPS usage, and data sharing.

- *🧩 Chrome Extension (optional)*  
  Real-time tracker insights while browsing.

- *📊 Interactive Visualizations*  
  Built using D3.js or Chart.js for intuitive analysis.

✨ Bonus/Nice-to-Have Features (In Progress or Future Plans)

- Tracker blocking and controls from UI  
- Real-time alerts on tracker-heavy websites  
- User profiles with historical tracking data  
- Integration with privacy tools (AdBlock, Ghostery, etc.)  
- Developer API for embedding Trackpeek in other apps

 📦 How It Works (High-Level)

1. Headless browser simulates user visit using Puppeteer  
2. Logs cookies, network requests, and third-party domains  
3. Classifies data by type, purpose, and origin  
4. Visualizes results with graphs and maps  
5. Computes privacy score based on tracker severity, HTTPS usage, etc.
